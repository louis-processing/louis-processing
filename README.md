### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on technology-related products for secondary schools in the Mississuaga Peel Region. In a nutshell, Anotip is an user-friendly, real-time, and anonymous reporting app whose mission is to maintain the safety and security of the school environment. Its inception comes from the personal experiences of both me and my co-founder. As freshman entering secondary school, we were shocked to see the frequency of substance misuse, harassment and bullying cases within school facilities as well as the larger community around us.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning programming languages like Rust, Python, Typescript and Dart!
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with programming languages like Python, Typescript and Dart!
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything related to finance and economics. I study all kinds of economic theories, from Keynesian to Austrian Economics. I am also a big proponent in teaching personal finance in high schools. Leaning to budget, save, manage debt and investing money in a diverse range of assets is essential to survival! Also, XQQ to the Moon!
